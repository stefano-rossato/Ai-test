# Git Auto Commit Rule

## Context
- Applies to all files modified by Cursor IDE's automatic changes
- Ensures consistent commit history for AI-generated modifications
- Implements conventional commit format standards
- Maintains traceability between prompts and code changes

## Requirements
- All AI-modified files must be automatically committed
- Commit messages must follow conventional commit format:
  - Type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
  - Optional scope in parentheses
  - Clear description
  - Detailed body explaining changes
  - Original prompts must be referenced
- Cursor IDE must:
  - Track modified files
  - Generate conventional commits
  - Handle merge conflicts
  - Execute git commands automatically

## Examples

```git

1. "Format the code according to PEP 8 standards"
2. "Ensure consistent indentation across all files"
```

### Invalid Commit
